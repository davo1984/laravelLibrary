 # Laravel Library

This is a project to help me practice my PHP skills, learn Laravel and the database engine Elequent.

This project simulates a library. There are books which can be viewed, checked out, and returned. Books which are checked out are listed with the return date or as overdue. Fines for late books are calculated. Librarians can create new book records, retire (delete) books, create new Patron records or manage Patron records. Managing Patron records involves forgiving fines, marking fines as paid, and changing maximum number of books which can be checked out.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
